            "The dorm is located on Amager and is Denmark's largest dorm with Apartments. There is a great deal of emphasis on housing democracy, which means that the dorm's many communal areas and committees will be managed by a residents council consisting of eight college residents who will be elected at the dorm's annual housing meeting. The commitees, also chosen at the residents 'meeting, consist of volunteer residents in charge of the operation of various facilities in the dorm (eg training centers, workshops, photo rooms, shelters, etc.). The residents thus contribute to creating the framework for the use of the dorm.",
            "Smoking and pets are not allowed on all indoor areas.",
            "NB! You must have at least one academic year left of your study from the desired date of occupation to apply for this college.",
            "The waiting time is 1-3 years depending on the type of accommodation you applied for.",
            "Residents who want to apply for internal moving at the dorm, must contact the administration on location.",
            "At this college there is a restoration at the start of the rental period, which means that if you eg. get a contract from the 1st in a month, then the rent will be reinstated from this date after which you can move in (it can take up to 14 days), but you pay rent from d. 1. In return, you may stay for the last day of your notice period, as the new tenant pays rent during the refurbishment period."
